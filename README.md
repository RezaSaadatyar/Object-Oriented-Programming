## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The repository introduces OOP in Python, covering key concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism through practical examples. It serves both beginners and experienced developers, focusing on designing modular, scalable, and maintainable Python programs.

## **Why This Repository is Useful?**<br/>
✅ Learn **OOP concepts** in Python with practical examples  
✅ Understand how to structure **software projects using OOP**  
✅ Implement **modular and reusable code** using **classes and objects**  
✅ Explore **best practices for software development with OOP**  

## **Contents**  
**Classes and Objects:** Defining classes, creating objects, working with instance and class attributes, and using constructors and initializers.<br/>
**Inheritance:** Implementing single and multiple inheritance, overriding methods, and using the super() function.<br/>
**Polymorphism:** Demonstrating method overriding for different behaviors in child classes and defining multiple behaviors for a method.<br/>
**Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Exploring the concept of abstract classes, using the ABC module, defining abstract methods, and creating and enforcing interfaces.<br/>
**Encapsulation:** Implementing access modifiers (public, protected, private), using getters and setters for private attributes, and working with property decorators and descriptors.<br/>
**Class and Static Methods:** Defining and using class methods and static methods, and understanding the differences between instance methods, class methods, and static methods.<br/>
**Magic Methods, Operator Overloading, and Dataclass:** Understanding magic (dunder) methods, implementing operator overloading, and working with item access methods.<br/>
**Decorators:** Applying decorators to enhance the functionality of classes and methods.<br/>
